        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="leading"><strong>"The devil is in the details, but so is salvation." - Hymen G. Rickover</strong></p>
        <p>This is a quote that has stuck with me throughout my entire career.</p>
        <p>From when I first learned it as a junior sailor in the Navy, it has been central to my development and approach to projects throughout the near-15 years of Naval service, in my current role as a Power Plant Engineer, and into my dream job of a Full Stack Developer. One common theme that resonates with me is that being a detail orientated person, I developed a unique ability to be analytical in my problem solving. This synergistic blend works great on my own, but where I truly succeed is collaborating with a team. I decided to pursue this career path because I have always been interested in tech and how it can be used to make our lives more efficient and allow for time to do the things we love.</p>
        <p>My <strong>goal-orientated</strong> and <strong>growth mindset</strong> when it comes to a team has, on a number of occasions, helped the team I was a part of on task and deliver our product either on time or even early. Due to the skills and various roles I have performed as I developed in the Navy and after enables me to look at a problem from different perspectives and be able to provide a complete solution.</p>
        <p>I'm now looking forward to honing my <strong>Front End Development</strong> skills with a company that values a growth mindset and developing their staff.</p>    </section>
